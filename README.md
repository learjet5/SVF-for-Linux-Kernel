# Intro

This repo is based on [SVF-2.8](https://github.com/SVF-tools/SVF/releases/tag/SVF-2.8). (Not support opaque pointers.)

We modify the code further to perform Linux kernel static analysis, which can work together with [LLVM-14.0.6](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-14.0.6).
